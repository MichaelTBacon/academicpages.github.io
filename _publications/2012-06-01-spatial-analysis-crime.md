This is a methodological paper that emerged from my master thesis work. To a
degree it attempts to wrestle with what I found as a dearth of information on
how to apply crime incident data to something other than by law enforcement,
specifically to community analysis.

Abstract
=====

While previous research has provided law enforcement agencies with trend
analysis based on geostatistical models, incident data mapping can also
estimate citizen experience of crime. We present a methodology for estimating
experience of "signal crimes" based on incident report data. We apply this
method to a HOPE VI project in Durham, NC by analyzing crime at public housing
complexes to which residences were relocated between 2002 and 2004. Declines
in experienced density of shooting from Few Gardens occurred with some
increases in experienced murder density. Results indicate that relocated
residents experienced improvements in crime levels but serious problems
persist.
